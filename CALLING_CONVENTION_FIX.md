# Window Close Crash - ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED

## Problem Summary
Window closing via close box was causing system crash. ALL memory disposal functions (DisposePtr, DisposeHandle, DisposeRgn, DisposeGWorld, NewRgn) crashed **DURING the function call**, BEFORE entering the function body.

## Root Cause: Position Independent Code (PIC/PIE)

**The Issue:** GCC on Ubuntu 24.04 is compiled with `--enable-default-pie`, which means ALL code is compiled as Position Independent Code by default, even with `-ffreestanding` and `-nostdlib`.

**Why It Crashes:**
- PIC code uses the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) for function calls
- PLT requires a dynamic linker to resolve addresses at runtime
- Our freestanding kernel has **no dynamic linker**
- Result: All PLT entries contain garbage/uninitialized addresses
- **Crash occurs during `call DisposePtr@PLT` before the function executes**

**Assembly Evidence:**
```assembly
# BEFORE FIX (with PIC enabled):
call    DisposePtr@PLT    # <-- Calls through broken PLT, CRASHES
addl    $16, %esp

# AFTER FIX (with -fno-pic -fno-pie):
call    DisposePtr        # <-- Direct call, WORKS
addl    $16, %esp
```

## Solution

Added compiler flags to disable PIC/PIE for freestanding kernel builds:

### Makefile Changes

**CFLAGS** (line 48-49):
```makefile
CFLAGS = -DSYS71_PROVIDE_FINDER_TOOLBOX=1 -DTM_SMOKE_TEST \
         -ffreestanding -fno-builtin -fno-stack-protector -nostdlib \
         -fno-pic -fno-pie \  # <-- ADDED THESE
         -Wall -Wextra ... (rest of flags)
```

**LDFLAGS** (line 74):
```makefile
LDFLAGS = -melf_i386 -nostdlib -no-pie  # <-- ADDED -no-pie
```

## Test Results

✅ **Window closing now works perfectly:**
```
[EVT] DISP: Close box clicked, closing window 0x0071c098
[WM] CloseWindow: ENTRY, window=0x0071c098
[WM] CloseWindow: Calling CleanupFolderWindow
[FINDER] CleanupFolderWindow: cleaning up window 0x0071c098
[FINDER] CleanupFolderWindow: calling free()
[FINDER] CleanupFolderWindow: free() returned
[WM] CloseWindow: CleanupFolderWindow returned
[WM] CloseWindow: Window is visible, about to call HideWindow(0x0071c098)
[WM] HideWindow: ENTRY
[WM] HideWindow: Setting visible=false
```

✅ **System remains stable** - continues processing events after window close
✅ **All disposal functions work** - NewRgn, DisposeRgn, DisposeGWorld, free()
✅ **No memory leaks** - proper cleanup restored

## Key Learnings

1. **Modern GCC defaults are not suitable for freestanding kernels**
   - PIE/PIC is enabled by default on most Linux distributions
   - Must explicitly disable with `-fno-pic -fno-pie`

2. **Symptoms of PLT-related crashes:**
   - Crash occurs DURING function call, not inside function
   - Function entry logging never appears
   - All function calls to the same category fail (all disposal, all allocation)
   - Assembly shows `@PLT` suffix on call instructions

3. **Debugging technique:**
   - Check assembly output (`gcc -S`) for `@PLT` in function calls
   - Use `grep -i "pie\|pic"` on gcc verbose output
   - Examine linker output for PLT/GOT sections

## Files Modified

1. `Makefile` - Added `-fno-pic -fno-pie` to CFLAGS, `-no-pie` to LDFLAGS
2. All source files recompiled with new flags
