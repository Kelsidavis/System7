# System 7.1 Portable - Code Organization Map

This document tracks component ownership and architectural boundaries to maintain clean separation between subsystems.

## Progress Summary
- Starting point: 655 compiler warnings
- After initial cleanup: 88 warnings  
- After Sound Manager type fixes: 494 warnings (BUILD NOW LINKS SUCCESSFULLY!)
- Missing prototypes: 232
- Other warnings: ~262

## Recent Fixes (Current Session)
1. ✅ Fixed Sound Manager type definitions (SoundTypes.h, SoundHardware.h)
2. ✅ Reverted incorrectly marked static functions
3. ✅ Build now links successfully - kernel.elf created!

## Next Steps
- Add missing function prototypes to appropriate headers
- Fix remaining misc warnings (unused variables, incompatible pointers, etc.)
- Target: ZERO warnings for C11+ transition
