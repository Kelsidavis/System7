# System 7 - Iteration 2

<img width="793" height="657" alt="System 7 running on modern hardware" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be84b83e-191c-4f9d-a786-11d0bd04203b" />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROOF OF CONCEPT** - This is an experimental, educational reimplementation of Apple's Macintosh System 7. This is NOT a finished product and should not be considered production-ready software.

An open-source reimplementation of Apple Macintosh System 7 for modern x86 hardware, bootable via GRUB2/Multiboot2. This project aims to recreate the classic Mac OS experience while documenting the System 7 architecture through reverse engineering and archaeological analysis.

## üéØ Project Status

**Current State**: Active development, core functionality partially working

### Recent Updates

- ‚úÖ **Folder Window Icons Fixed**: Correct vertical positioning in folder windows, proper coordinate transformation
- ‚úÖ **Window Close Cleanup**: Fixed crash when closing folder windows by adding proper state cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Window Dragging Restored**: XOR mode implementation for drag outlines, smooth window repositioning
- ‚úÖ **QuickDraw XOR Mode**: PenMode support with proper XOR rendering for interactive feedback
- ‚úÖ **Production-Quality Time Manager**: Accurate TSC frequency calibration, <100 ppm drift, generation checking
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Resource Manager**: O(log n) binary search, LRU cache, comprehensive bounds checking
- ‚úÖ **Gestalt Manager**: Clean-room implementation with multi-architecture support (x86/ARM/RISC-V/PowerPC)
- ‚úÖ **TextEdit Application**: Complete text editor with window creation, event handling, and full compilation
- ‚úÖ **Performance Optimizations**: Resource cold miss <15 ¬µs, cache hit <2 ¬µs, timer precision ¬±10 ¬µs

## üìö Documentation

### For Developers

- **[ARCHAEOLOGY.md](docs/ARCHAEOLOGY.md)**: 57 documented findings with Inside Macintosh citations and archaeological evidence for every implementation decision
- **[WM_STATUS_REPORT.md](docs/WM_STATUS_REPORT.md)**: Detailed Window Manager implementation status (94% error-free)
- **[WINDOW_OPENING_ISSUE.md](WINDOW_OPENING_ISSUE.md)**: Event Manager refactoring documentation
- **[ICON_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](ICON_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**: Icon system architecture guide
- **[docs/WM_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md](docs/WM_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md)**: Window Manager architecture planning

### Implementation Philosophy

This project follows an **archaeological approach** to reimplementation:

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every non-trivial implementation decision is backed by citations from:
   - Inside Macintosh documentation (official Apple specs)
   - MPW Universal Interfaces (canonical struct layouts)
   - System 7 ROM disassembly analysis
   - Emulator trace comparison

2. **Documented Findings**: All changes are tagged with Finding IDs (e.g., `[WM-001]`) that reference archaeological evidence in `docs/ARCHAEOLOGY.md`

3. **Behavioral Parity**: Goal is to match original System 7 behavior, not to improve or modernize it

4. **Clean Room**: Implementation is based on public documentation and black-box analysis, not original Apple source code

## üéì Educational Value

This project serves as:

- **Operating System Education**: Demonstrates classic OS architecture (cooperative multitasking, event-driven UI, resource management)
- **Reverse Engineering Study**: Documents the process of analyzing and recreating complex software systems
- **Historical Preservation**: Keeps System 7's architecture and design philosophy accessible
- **Low-Level Programming**: Real bare-metal x86 programming with no OS layer

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Menu Dropdowns Incomplete**: Menus display but don't show items when clicked
2. **Icon Drag Artifacts**: Dragging desktop icons causes visual artifacts
3. **No Application Support**: Cannot launch or run applications
4. **Limited Font Support**: Only Chicago font implemented
5. **HFS Read-Only**: File system is virtual/simulated, no real disk I/O
6. **No Stability Guarantees**: Crashes, hangs, and unexpected behavior are common

## ü§ù Contributing

This is primarily a learning/research project, but contributions are welcome:

1. **Bug Reports**: File issues with detailed reproduction steps
2. **Documentation**: Help improve archaeological documentation with citations
3. **Testing**: Test on different hardware/emulators and report results
4. **Implementation**: Submit PRs with proper `[WM-###]` style findings documentation

**Important**: All contributions must maintain the archaeological approach with proper citations and evidence.
