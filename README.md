# System 7

<img width="793" height="657" alt="System 7 running on modern hardware" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be84b83e-191c-4f9d-a786-11d0bd04203b" />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROOF OF CONCEPT** - This is an experimental, educational reimplementation of Apple's Macintosh System 7. This is NOT a finished product and should not be considered production-ready software.

An open-source reimplementation of Apple Macintosh System 7 for modern x86 hardware, bootable via GRUB2/Multiboot2. This project aims to recreate the classic Mac OS experience while documenting the System 7 architecture through reverse engineering analysis.

## üî® Building

### Requirements

- **GCC** with 32-bit support (`gcc-multilib` on 64-bit systems)
- **GNU Make**
- **GRUB tools**: `grub-mkrescue` (from `grub2-common` or `grub-pc-bin`)
- **QEMU** for testing (`qemu-system-i386`)
- **Python 3** for resource processing
- **xxd** for binary conversion

### Ubuntu/Debian Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib grub-pc-bin xorriso qemu-system-x86 python3 vim-common
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build kernel only
make

# Create bootable ISO
make iso

# Build and run in QEMU
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Check exported symbols
make check-exports

# Display build statistics
make info
```

## üöÄ Running

### Quick Start (QEMU)

```bash
# Standard run with serial logging
make run

# Or manually:
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom system71.iso -serial file:/tmp/serial.log -display sdl -vga std -m 256M
```

### Run Options

```bash
# Debug with GDB
make debug
# In another terminal: gdb kernel.elf -ex "target remote :1234"

# Custom QEMU options
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom system71.iso \
  -serial stdio \           # Serial to console
  -display sdl \            # SDL window
  -vga std \                # Standard VGA
  -m 256M                   # 256MB RAM
```

### Real Hardware

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Running on real hardware is experimental and may not work. Use at your own risk.

1. Write ISO to USB drive: `dd if=system71.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M`
2. Boot from USB with legacy BIOS (not UEFI)
3. Serial output available on COM1 (115200 baud) if available

### Implementation Philosophy

This project follows an **archaeological approach** to reimplementation:

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every non-trivial implementation decision is backed by citations from:
   - Inside Macintosh documentation (official Apple specs)
   - MPW Universal Interfaces (canonical struct layouts)
   - System 7 ROM disassembly analysis
   - Emulator trace comparison

2. **Documented Findings**: All changes are tagged with Finding IDs (e.g., `[WM-001]`) that reference archaeological evidence in `docs/ARCHAEOLOGY.md`

3. **Behavioral Parity**: Goal is to match original System 7 behavior, not to improve or modernize it

4. **Clean Room**: Implementation is based on public documentation and black-box analysis, not original Apple source code

## üéì Educational Value

This project serves as:

- **Operating System Education**: Demonstrates classic OS architecture (cooperative multitasking, event-driven UI, resource management)
- **Reverse Engineering Study**: Documents the process of analyzing and recreating complex software systems
- **Historical Preservation**: Keeps System 7's architecture and design philosophy accessible
- **Low-Level Programming**: Real bare-metal x86 programming with no OS layer

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Icon Drag Artifacts**: Dragging desktop icons may cause visual artifacts
2. **Application Execution Stubbed**: Segment loader complete, but M68K interpreter execution loop not yet implemented
3. **No TrueType Support**: Font Manager supports bitmap fonts only (Chicago)
4. **HFS Read-Only**: File system is virtual/simulated, no real disk I/O
5. **No Stability Guarantees**: Crashes, hangs, and unexpected behavior are common

## ü§ù Contributing

This is primarily a learning/research project, but contributions are welcome:

1. **Bug Reports**: File issues with detailed reproduction steps
3. **Testing**: Test on different hardware/emulators and report results

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal

This is a **clean-room reimplementation** for **educational and preservation purposes**.

- **No Apple source code** was used in this implementation
- Implementation is based on public documentation and black-box analysis
- "System 7", "Macintosh", "QuickDraw", and Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc.
- This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Apple Inc.

### Fair Use Rationale

This project exists for:
- Educational purposes (teaching OS design and implementation)
- Historical preservation (documenting 1980s-90s OS architecture)
- Interoperability research (understanding file formats and protocols)

**Original System 7 ROM and software remain property of Apple Inc.** This reimplementation does not include or require original Apple software to function.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Apple Computer, Inc.** for creating the original System 7
- **Inside Macintosh authors** for comprehensive documentation
- **Classic Mac preservation community** for keeping the platform alive
- **68k.news and Macintosh Garden** for resource archives and documentation

## üìä Project Statistics

- **Lines of Code**: ~57,500+ (including 2,500+ for segment loader)
- **Development Time**: Several months (ongoing)
- **Compilation Time**: ~3-5 seconds on modern hardware
- **Kernel Size**: ~1.8MB (kernel.elf)
- **ISO Size**: ~12.5MB (system71.iso)
- **Error Reduction**: 94% (30 of 32 Window Manager errors resolved)
- **New Managers Added**: 5 (Font Manager, Gestalt, enhanced Resource, production Time Manager, Segment Loader)

## üîÆ Future Direction

This project is in **active development** with no guaranteed timeline. Planned work includes:

**Short Term** (Proof of Concept Completion):
- Fix desktop artifacts
- Debug window close crash issue
- Complete window resizing functionality

**Medium Term** (Core Toolbox):
- Complete Window Definition Procedure (WDEF) dispatch
- Implement additional controls (text fields, pop-up menus, sliders)
- Add TrueType font support to Font Manager

**Long Term** (Application Support):
- ‚úÖ Segment Loader for loading CODE resources (complete)
- ‚úÖ Process Manager integration with segment loader (complete)
- Complete M68K interpreter execution loop
- Add PPC backend for fat binary support
- Basic desk accessories (Calculator, Note Pad)

**Stretch Goals** (Full System):
- Sound Manager with sample playback
- AppleTalk networking stack
- Color QuickDraw with 8-bit palette support
