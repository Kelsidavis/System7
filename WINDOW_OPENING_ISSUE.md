# Window Opening Issue Resolution

## Problem Statement
Windows were not opening when users double-clicked icons or pressed Tab/Enter due to event dispatch problems. Investigation revealed multiple conflicting implementations of GetNextEvent causing event routing failures.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Multiple GetNextEvent Implementations Found
1. **src/all_stubs.c:255** - Stub returning false (was blocking events)
2. **src/sys71_stubs.c:87** - Queue-based implementation (was working but now disabled)
3. **src/EventManager/event_manager.c** - NEW CANONICAL IMPLEMENTATION
4. **src/EventManager/EventManagerCore.c:378** - Duplicate implementation (now disabled)
5. **src/ProcessMgr/EventIntegration.c:81** - Process Manager hook (now disabled)

### Key Discovery
Multiple files were defining GetNextEvent, PostEvent, and EventAvail, causing linking conflicts and unpredictable behavior. The project needed a single, authoritative Event Manager implementation.

## Resolution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyzed All Event Handling Code
- Identified 5 different GetNextEvent implementations
- Found that sys71_stubs.c had the most complete queue logic
- Discovered EventManagerCore.c and EventIntegration.c weren't even being compiled

### ✅ Step 2: Created Canonical Event Manager
- Moved the working queue-based implementation from sys71_stubs.c to EventManager/event_manager.c
- This is now the single source of truth for:
  - GetNextEvent - Dequeues and returns matching events
  - EventAvail - Checks for events without removing them
  - PostEvent - Adds events to the queue
  - FlushEvents - Removes events from the queue

### ✅ Step 3: Disabled All Duplicate Implementations
- **all_stubs.c**: Commented out GetNextEvent and EventAvail stubs
- **sys71_stubs.c**: Disabled GetNextEvent, PostEvent, EventAvail, and FlushEvents with #if 0 blocks
- **EventManagerCore.c**: Disabled duplicate functions with #if 0 blocks
- **EventIntegration.c**: Disabled Process Manager versions with #if 0 blocks

### ✅ Step 4: Updated Build System
- Added src/EventManager/event_manager.c to Makefile
- Verified no duplicate symbols during linking
- Kept external dependencies (GetMouse from PS2Controller, TickCount from sys71_stubs)

### ✅ Step 5: Added Comprehensive Debug Logging
Enhanced event_manager.c with detailed logging:
```c
PostEvent: Posting mouseDown (type=1), msg=0x00000000, queue count=0
PostEvent: Mouse event with message=0x00000000 at (100,100)
PostEvent: Successfully posted mouseDown at position 0, queue now has 1 events
GetNextEvent: Called with mask=0x04ff, queue count=1
  Looking for: mouseDown
  Looking for: mouseUp
  Looking for: keyDown
GetNextEvent: Found matching event: mouseDown (type=1) at index=0
GetNextEvent: Event where={x=100,y=100}, msg=0x00000000, modifiers=0x0000
GetNextEvent: Returning mouseDown at (100,100)
DispatchEvent: windowOpen
```

## Architectural Improvements

### Single Canonical Implementation
```
EventManager/event_manager.c
├── GetNextEvent()      - Main event retrieval
├── EventAvail()        - Non-destructive check
├── PostEvent()         - Event posting
├── FlushEvents()       - Queue clearing
├── WaitNextEvent()     - Stub calling GetNextEvent
└── GenerateSystemEvent() - Internal helper
```

### Clear Dependency Structure
```
event_manager.c depends on:
├── PS2Controller.c     - GetMouse(), Button()
├── sys71_stubs.c       - TickCount(), InitEvents()
├── control_stubs.c     - StillDown()
├── KeyboardEvents.c    - GetKeys()
└── ModernInput.c       - UpdateMouseState()
```

### Event Flow Architecture
1. **Input Generation**: Hardware/platform posts events via PostEvent
2. **Queue Management**: Circular FIFO queue in event_manager.c
3. **Event Retrieval**: GetNextEvent with mask filtering
4. **Dispatch**: Main loop calls appropriate handlers
5. **Window Management**: Events trigger window operations

## Test Results

### Build Verification
- ✅ No duplicate symbol errors
- ✅ Clean compilation of event_manager.c
- ✅ All dependencies resolved correctly

### Event System Testing
- ✅ Events post to queue successfully
- ✅ GetNextEvent retrieves events in FIFO order
- ✅ Event masks filter correctly
- ✅ EventAvail checks without dequeuing
- ✅ FlushEvents removes matching events

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Keyboard events (Tab/Enter) dispatch properly
- ✅ Mouse events (clicks/double-clicks) work
- ✅ Windows open when icons double-clicked
- ✅ Menus respond to clicks
- ✅ Update events delivered to windows

## Implementation Details

### Event Queue Structure
```c
#define MAX_EVENTS 32
static struct {
    EventRecord events[MAX_EVENTS];
    int head;
    int tail;
    int count;
} g_eventQueue = {0};
```

### Debug Logging Format
Each event operation logs:
- Function called with parameters
- Events being searched for (mask breakdown)
- Events found/posted with details
- Queue state changes
- Mouse positions and modifiers

## Lessons Learned

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Core system functions must have exactly one implementation
2. **Clear Ownership**: Each subsystem should own its functions exclusively
3. **Explicit Dependencies**: Use extern declarations for cross-module functions
4. **Conditional Compilation**: Use #if 0 to disable code cleanly
5. **Build System Accuracy**: Makefile must include all active source files
6. **Debug Visibility**: Comprehensive logging is essential for event debugging

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Unified GetNextEvent into Event Manager
- ✅ Disabled sys71_stubs.c and all_stubs.c stubs
- ✅ Added EventAvail
- ✅ Events flow correctly (keyboard + mouse)
- ✅ Windows open and redraw
- ✅ Menus track and dismiss properly
- ✅ No linking conflicts
- ✅ Debug logs show complete event flow

## Status: RESOLVED

The Event Manager has been successfully refactored into a single canonical implementation in EventManager/event_manager.c. All duplicate implementations have been disabled, and the event system now works correctly with proper queue management, event filtering, and debug visibility. Windows open properly in response to both keyboard and mouse events.
