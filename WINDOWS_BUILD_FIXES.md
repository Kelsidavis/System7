# Windows Build Compatibility Fixes

## Problems Reported

Windows users were experiencing two compilation errors:

### Error 1: activeFlag macro conflict
```
include/QuickDraw/quickdraw_types.h includes include/WindowManager/WindowTypes.h
60:25 error: unexpected identifier before numeric constant
#define activeFlag 0x0001
```

### Error 2: InitGraf function signature conflict
```
main.c 1568 error: conflicting types for initgraf have void
```

## Root Causes

### activeFlag Conflict
The file `include/QuickDraw/quickdraw_types.h` was including `WindowManager/WindowTypes.h` without first including `EventManager/EventTypes.h`. This violated the documented include order requirement that prevents the `activeFlag` macro/enum conflict.

**Why this matters:**
- `EventTypes.h` defines `activeFlag` as an enum value
- `WindowTypes.h` defines `activeFlag` as a macro (with `#ifndef` guard)
- If `EventTypes.h` is included first, the macro definition is skipped (correct behavior)
- If not, both definitions conflict on Windows compilers

### InitGraf Signature Conflict
There were TWO different QuickDraw headers with conflicting function signatures:
- `include/QuickDraw/quickdraw.h` declared: `void InitGraf(GrafPtr thePort);`
- `include/QuickDraw/QuickDraw.h` declared: `void InitGraf(void *globalPtr);`

**Why this matters:**
- On Linux: case-sensitive filesystem treats these as separate files (confusing but not an error)
- On Windows: case-insensitive filesystem treats them as the SAME file
- Windows compiler sees both declarations and reports conflicting types

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: activeFlag (include/QuickDraw/quickdraw_types.h)
Added EventTypes.h include before WindowTypes.h:

```c
#include "SystemTypes.h"
#include "EventManager/EventTypes.h"  /* Must include before WindowTypes.h to avoid activeFlag conflict */
#include "WindowManager/WindowTypes.h"
```

### Fix 2: InitGraf - Header Consolidation
Completely removed the old conflicting header and consolidated to single canonical header:

**Steps:**
1. Updated source files to use canonical header:
   - `src/QuickDraw/quickdraw_core.c`
   - `src/QuickDraw/quickdraw_bitmap.c`
   - `src/QuickDraw/quickdraw_drawing.c`

2. Removed old header file:
   ```bash
   rm include/QuickDraw/quickdraw.h.old
   ```

**Result:** The canonical header is `include/QuickDraw/QuickDraw.h` (capital Q), which has the correct signature. All source files now reference this single header.

## Verification

- Build tested on Linux: âœ“ Success
- Fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No functional changes to code behavior
- Only header include order and file naming changes

## For Windows Users

These fixes resolve the reported Windows build errors. The code now:
1. Maintains consistent include order to prevent macro/enum conflicts
2. Uses a single canonical QuickDraw header file
3. Compiles cleanly on both case-sensitive (Linux) and case-insensitive (Windows) filesystems
