 * Parameters:
 *   qElement - Pointer to queue element to add

 * Queue structure:
 *   QHdr contains qHead (first element) and qTail (last element)

 * Dequeue - Remove an element from a queue
 *
 * Removes a specified queue element from anywhere in a queue. The function

 *
 * Parameters:
 *   qElement - Pointer to queue element to remove
 *   qHeader - Pointer to queue header
 *
 * Returns:
 *   noErr (0) if successful
 *   qErr (-1) if element not found in queue
 *
 * Note: Unlike Enqueue which always adds to the tail, Dequeue can remove
 * an element from anywhere in the queue by searching for it.
