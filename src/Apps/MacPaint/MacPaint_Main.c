/*
 * CONVERSION NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
 *
 * This file integrates the converted MacPaint code with System 7.1.
 * The following conversions were made from the original Pascal/68k source:
 *
 * 1. PASCAL TO C CONVERSION (MacPaint.p):
 *    - PROCEDURE/FUNCTION declarations → C function prototypes
 *    - VAR declarations → static global or local variables
 *    - TYPE records → C structs
 *    - String[255] → C char arrays
 *    - Boolean → boolean (or int where needed)
 *    - EXTERNAL procedures → Functions in MacPaint_Core.c
 *
 * 2. 68K ASSEMBLY TO C CONVERSION:
 *
 *    a) MyHeapAsm.a (Memory Manager):
 *       - MoreMasters → MoreMasters() [calls Memory Manager]
 *       - FreeMem → FreeMem() [calls Memory Manager]
 *       - MaxMem → MaxMem() [calls Memory Manager]
 *       - NewHandle → NewHandle() [calls Memory Manager]
 *       - DisposHandle → DisposeHandle() [calls Memory Manager]
 *       - HLock/HUnlock → HLock/HUnlock() [bit manipulation]
 *       - HPurge/HNoPurge → HPurge/HNoPurge() [bit manipulation]
 *
 *    b) MyTools.a (Toolbox Traps):
 *       - Direct .WORD definitions of trap codes
 *       - These are replaced by System 7.1 Toolbox function calls
 *       - Examples: InitCurs, SetCursor, HideCursor, ShowCursor, etc
 *       - All become function calls to our Toolbox implementations
 *
 *    c) PaintAsm.a (Painting Algorithms):
 *       - PixelTrue → MacPaint_PixelTrue() [bit extraction]
 *       - SetPixel/ClearPixel → MacPaint_SetPixel/ClearPixel()
 *       - InvertBuf → MacPaint_InvertBuf() [XOR all bits]
 *       - ZeroBuf → MacPaint_ZeroBuf() [memset]
 *       - DrawBrush → MacPaint_DrawBrush() [pattern drawing]
 *       - ExpandPat → MacPaint_ExpandPattern() [pattern expansion]
 *       - TrimBBox → MacPaint_TrimBBox() [bounds calculation]
 *       - PackBits/UnpackBits → MacPaint_PackBits/UnpackBits() [RLE codec]
 *       - CalcEdges → MacPaint_CalcEdges() [edge detection]
 *
 * 3. SYSTEM-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS:
 *    - BitMap structures use QuickDraw format
 *    - Window/Port management uses System 7.1 Window Manager
 *    - Event handling adapted to System 7.1 Event Manager
 *    - File I/O uses System 7.1 File Manager
 *    - Menu handling through System 7.1 Menu Manager
 *    - Drawing through System 7.1 QuickDraw (monochrome)
 *
 * 4. KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 *    - Printing support simplified (no style-based formatting yet)
 *    - Text tool partially implemented
 *    - Some advanced drawing modes not yet ported
 *    - Undo/Redo limited (single level currently)
 *    - Scrap format may differ from original
 *
 * 5. BUILD INTEGRATION:
 *    - Added to Makefile: src/Apps/MacPaint/MacPaint_Core.c, MacPaint_Main.c
 *    - Header: include/Apps/MacPaint.h
 *    - Compiled as part of System 7.1 kernel
 *    - Launched as document-based application from Finder
 *
 * For questions about specific conversions, see the comments in MacPaint_Core.c
