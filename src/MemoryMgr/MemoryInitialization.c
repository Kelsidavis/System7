 * MoreMasters - Allocate additional master pointer blocks
 *
 * Allocates one or more blocks of master pointers to allow the creation
 * of more relocatable blocks (handles). Each call allocates space for
 * 64 additional master pointers in the current heap zone.
 *
 * This function should be called early in program initialization if the
 * application expects to create many handles. Multiple calls can be made
 * to preallocate sufficient master pointers.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Each master pointer block uses 64 * sizeof(Ptr) bytes
 * - On 32-bit systems, this is 64 * 4 = 256 bytes per block
 * - Preallocating master pointers prevents heap fragmentation
 * - This function is a no-op if allocation fails (graceful degradation)
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   MoreMasters();  // Allocate 64 master pointers
 *   MoreMasters();  // Allocate another 64
 *   MoreMasters();  // Allocate another 64
 *   // Now have space for 192 additional handles

 * SetGrowZone - Install a grow zone function
 *
 * Installs a grow zone function that is called when the Memory Manager

 *
 * Parameters:
 *   growZone - Pointer to grow zone function (NULL to remove)
 *
 * The grow zone function should have this signature:
 *   long GrowZoneProc(Size cbNeeded);
 *
 * The function should:
 * - Attempt to free at least cbNeeded bytes
 * - Return the number of bytes freed
 * - Avoid allocating memory (would cause recursion)
 * - Avoid moving locked blocks
 *
 * Returns:
 *   The number of bytes freed (0 if nothing freed)
 *
 * Example grow zone function:
 *   long MyGrowZone(Size cbNeeded) {
 *       // Purge caches
 *       PurgeCaches(cbNeeded);
 *       // Close non-essential windows
 *       CloseOldestWindow();
