## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### What Was Analyzed
- 185,659 lines of C code
- 41 major subsystem directories
- 200+ TODO/FIXME markers
- 58 files with incomplete implementations
- Header files and include paths
- Integration points between systems
- Dependency chains
- Platform-specific implementations

### How Completeness Was Determined
1. **TODO/FIXME Count** - Identified explicitly marked incomplete items
2. **Stub Function Detection** - Found functions returning unimpErr or noErr
3. **Architecture Review** - Examined integration with other systems
4. **Feature Inventory** - Compared with Mac OS System 7.1 specifications
5. **Code Analysis** - Determined implementation depth of each component

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence** (95-100%): Directly examined source code
- **Medium Confidence** (80-95%): Inferred from patterns and comments
- **Lower Confidence** (50-80%): Based on API patterns and naming

### Known Limitations
- Platform-specific details not fully analyzed
- Performance characteristics not evaluated
- Security aspects not audited
- Real-time behavior not verified
- Integration testing requirements unknown

## SUMMARY

The System 7.1 Portable project is **well-architected** with excellent coverage of core Mac OS systems. The identified gaps are **strategic** rather than critical - the system works well for its intended scope but lacks:

1. Printing support (document workflows)
2. Networking (multi-machine capabilities)
3. Extensibility (third-party support)
4. Advanced graphics (color support)
5. Multi-user support (file sharing)

**Next steps:** Complete Phase 1 (UI polish) for immediate large improvement, then prioritize based on use cases and available resources.
