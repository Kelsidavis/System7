# Font Manager Implementation

## Overview

System 7.1-compatible Font Manager providing bitmap font support with the Chicago strike embedded in the tree. The manager owns font registration, strike lookup, metrics, measurement, and drawing helpers that QuickDraw depends on.

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Architecture ✓
- `FontTypes.h` – System 7.1-compatible types
- `FontManager.h` – public API surface
- `FontManagerCore.c` – runtime state, strike selection, `InitFonts()` bootstrap

**Key APIs**
- `InitFonts()` wires the built-in families (Chicago, Geneva, Monaco)
- `GetFontName()`/`GetFNum()` swap between IDs and Pascal names
- `RealFont()` reports whether a requested size/style exists without synthesis
- `TextFont()`/`TextFace()`/`TextSize()`/`TextMode()` update the current GrafPort
- `GetFontMetrics()` + `CharWidth()`/`StringWidth()` return ascent, descent, advance
- `FMSwapFont()` swaps the active strike based on style/size arguments

### Phase 2: Resource Loading ✓
- `FontResources.h` and `FontResourceLoader.c` parse FOND/NFNT blobs
- `FM_LoadFONDResource()` + `FM_LoadNFNTResource()` populate strikes from resources
- `FM_ParseOWTTable()` + `FM_ExtractBitmap()` build usable offset/width tables
- Includes validation and debug dump helpers for reverse-engineering sessions

### Integration Points
- **QuickDraw**: `FM_DrawRun()` and `DrawString()` emit glyphs by calling `FM_DrawChicagoCharInternal()` which reads from `chicago_bitmap` in `src/chicago_font_data.c`
- **Window Manager**: window titles, menu tracking, and dialog chrome all call into `DrawString()` backed by the Font Manager
- **Legacy note**: `src/deprecated/ChicagoRealFont.deprecated.c` contains the original bring-up renderer; it remains for archeology only and is not linked into the build

### Font Data
- Source: `include/chicago_font.h` + `src/chicago_font_data.c`
- Metrics: ascent 12 px, descent 3 px, leading 3 px, printable ASCII 0x20–0x7E
- `ChicagoCharInfo` table supplies bit offsets, ink widths, side bearings, and logical advances; space has an explicit +3 px adjustment to match System 7 spacing

### Style Synthesis ✓
- `FontStyleSynthesis.c` implements bold (1 px embolden), italic shear, underline, shadow, outline, condense/extend spacing adjustments, and combined effects using the same internal renderer hooks
- `FontScaling.c` contains nearest-neighbour upsizing for larger point sizes, sharing the Chicago strike as a base

### Caching Strategy (current vs. future)
- **Current**: single built-in 12-pt strike kept hot in `g_fmState`
- **Planned**: LRU-managed strike list with memory caps (~256 KB) as additional bitmap sizes/styles land

### Testing Hooks
- `test_fontmgr.c` exercises family enumeration, metrics, width calculations, style synthesis, and `FMSwapFont()` behaviour
- Standard window/menu smoke runs hit the drawing path continually; any regression shows as blank text immediately

### Known Limitations
1. Only the Chicago 12 strike ships today; Geneva and Monaco reuse the same metrics
2. Runtime resource loading exists but is not yet hooked to disk or the Resource Manager
3. TrueType support is still out of scope
4. Italic rendering relies on bitmap shearing and is visually close but not pixel-perfect to ROM output
5. Cache invalidation once additional strikes arrive still needs real-world tuning

### Next Steps
- Bridge the Font Manager to the Resource Manager once we can fetch FOND/NFNT data from disk images
- Harden the scaling/synthesis paths with regression images so new styles preserve System 7 look
- Replace hard-coded Chicago metrics in Standard Controls once Geneva/Monaco become distinct strikes
