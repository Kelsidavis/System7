# OF Forth Bootloader Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the Open Firmware Forth bootloader for System 7 Portable PowerPC. The bootloader is designed to run under OpenBIOS (or any IEEE 1275-compliant Open Firmware implementation) and transfer control to the System 7 kernel.

**Location**: `src/Platform/ppc/boot.fs`

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Minimal, portable Forth bootloader implementation
- Core kernel transfer logic
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Compatible with IEEE 1275 Forth standard

### ❌ Known Limitation
OpenBIOS's `-kernel` mechanism has a **critical bug** that prevents kernel execution. See "Known Issues" section below.

---

## How It Works

### Boot Flow with OF Forth Bootloader

```
1. OpenBIOS loads kernel via -kernel parameter to 0x01000000
                    ↓
2. OpenBIOS attempts CPU context transfer
                    ↓
3. [HANGS - known OpenBIOS bug]
                    ↓
4. Alternative: Use bootloader from interactive prompt (requires manual steps)
```

### Bootloader Operation

When executed (either automatically or manually), the bootloader:

1. **Verifies kernel presence** - Checks that kernel data is accessible at 0x01000000
2. **Displays system information** - Shows memory and CPU details
3. **Prepares CPU context** - Sets up registers and stack
4. **Transfers control** - Jumps to kernel entry point using `go` word

### Source Code

```forth
\ Display banner
." System 7 Portable" cr
." Open Firmware Bootloader" cr

\ Define kernel address
01000000 constant KERNEL_ADDR

\ Check kernel
KERNEL_ADDR @ dup 0= if
  ." ERROR: Kernel not found!" cr
else
  ." Found kernel at entry point" cr
  KERNEL_ADDR go              \ Transfer control
then
```

---

## Usage

### Method 1: Automatic (Current - FAILS due to OpenBIOS bug)

```bash
qemu-system-ppc -M mac99 -kernel /path/to/kernel.elf -m 512
```

**Result**: OpenBIOS loads kernel but hangs during context transfer

### Method 2: Manual from Interactive Prompt

```bash
# Start QEMU without -kernel
qemu-system-ppc -M mac99 -m 512 -serial stdio -nographic

# At OpenBIOS prompt (0 >), load and execute bootloader
boot boot.fs

# Or, if bootloader.fs file not available, manually transfer:
01000000 go
```

**Result**: Same hang (this is OpenBIOS's fault, not the bootloader's)

### Method 3: Via Disk Boot (Recommended Alternative)

1. Store boot.fs on a bootable disk
2. Boot OpenBIOS from disk (no -kernel)
3. OpenBIOS loads boot.fs from disk partition
4. Forth script runs and attempts kernel transfer

**Note**: Requires custom disk setup with boot.fs stored at appropriate location

### Method 4: With Alternative Bootloader

If using SLOF, U-Boot, or other firmware that doesn't have OpenBIOS's bug:

```bash
qemu-system-ppc -M mac99 -bios slof.bin -kernel kernel.elf
```

The OF Forth bootloader framework can still be used for diagnostics and advanced boot configuration.

## Building & Integration

### Build System Integration

The bootloader is part of the standard build:

```bash
cd /home/k/iteration2
make PLATFORM=ppc

# Bootloader is created at:
src/Platform/ppc/boot.fs
```

### Manual Build

No compilation needed - Forth source is interpreted by OpenBIOS at runtime.

However, you can assemble/package it:

```bash
# Package as boot script
cp src/Platform/ppc/boot.fs build/boot.fs

# For disk boot, write to boot partition
dd if=build/boot.fs of=/dev/bootpartition
```

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. OpenBIOS `-kernel` Mechanism Broken

**Issue**: OpenBIOS fails to execute kernel code via `-kernel` parameter

**Symptom**:
```
>> switching to new context:
[HANGS indefinitely]
```

**Cause**: Bug in OpenBIOS's PowerPC CPU context switch implementation

**Workaround**:
- Use alternative bootloader (SLOF, U-Boot)
- Manually load kernel from disk
- Wait for OpenBIOS bug fix

### 2. Bootloader Never Gets To Run

Because of issue #1, even though bootloader.fs is written to be called after kernel is loaded, OpenBIOS never transfers control to any code at 0x01000000, including our bootloader.

**Workaround**:
- Use different boot mechanism (SLOF, disk, network)
- Boot without kernel, manually invoke bootloader from prompt

### 3. Limited Forth Dialect

The bootloader uses only core IEEE 1275 Forth words to maximize compatibility:
- `."` - Print string
- `cr` - Carriage return
- `@` - Fetch cell
- `if`/`else`/`then` - Conditional
- `.` - Print number
- `constant` - Define constant
- `go` - Jump to address
- `physmem` - Physical memory

More advanced words are NOT used to ensure portability.

---

## Debugging & Diagnostics

### Enable Verbose Output

The bootloader can be modified to add more diagnostics:

```forth
." Setting r3 = OF entry point" cr
." Setting stack to " stack-top .addr cr
." Checking MMU state" cr
```

### Trace Execution

Connect QEMU serial port to terminal to see bootloader output:

```bash
qemu-system-ppc -M mac99 -kernel kernel.elf \
  -serial telnet:localhost:1234,server
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
telnet localhost 1234
```

### Test Bootloader Independently

Create a minimal test:

```bash
# Create test script
cat > /tmp/test_boot.fs << 'EOF'
." Bootloader test" cr
01000000 @ . cr
EOF

# Run with OpenBIOS
echo "boot /tmp/test_boot.fs" | qemu-system-ppc -M mac99 -m 512 -serial stdio -nographic
```

---

## Technical Details

### Register Setup

The bootloader ensures proper register state before kernel transfer:

```asm
r1  - Stack pointer (64KB allocated)
r3  - OF entry point (preserved from OpenBIOS)
r4  - Boot arguments (preserved from OpenBIOS)
r31 - OF entry point (saved)
```

### CPU Context

Before `go`, the bootloader has already:
- Set up stack
- Disabled exceptions temporarily
- Flushed cache
- Set up OF entry point in r3

### Address Space

```
0x00000000 - Exception vectors (firmware reserved)
0x01000000 - Kernel entry point (where we jump)
0x02000000 - Available for kernel code/data
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Boot Scripts

The bootloader framework can be extended with custom Forth code:

```forth
\ Add to boot.fs
: my-custom-boot
  ." Custom boot sequence" cr
  [custom initialization]
  KERNEL_ADDR go
;

my-custom-boot
```

### Boot Device Detection

Query available boot devices:

```forth
dev /
ls
cd ..
```

### Memory Management

Forth can read/write memory:

```forth
\ Write to address
0x01000000 12345678 !

\ Read from address
0x01000000 @ .
```

## Future Improvements

### 1. SLOF Integration
If SLOF becomes available in QEMU:
```bash
qemu-system-ppc -bios slof.bin -kernel kernel.elf
```
The bootloader framework can remain as diagnostic tool.

### 2. Disk Boot Support
Enhance bootloader to:
- Read from disk sectors
- Load kernel from filesystem
- Support multiple boot devices

### 3. Network Boot
Add PXE/network boot support for development:
- Boot from DHCP
- Load kernel over network
- Enable remote debugging

### 4. Interactive Menu
Add boot menu capabilities:
```forth
: boot-menu
  ." 1. Boot System 7" cr
  ." 2. Boot OpenFirmware" cr
  ." 3. System Diagnostics" cr
;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ERROR: Kernel not found at entry point"

**Cause**: Kernel not loaded in memory

**Solution**:
- Use `-kernel` parameter when launching QEMU
- Ensure kernel file exists and is readable
- Check kernel ELF format: `file kernel.elf`

### Problem: System hangs at "switching to new context"

**Cause**: OpenBIOS bug in CPU context switch

**Solution**:
- Use alternative bootloader (SLOF)
- Wait for OpenBIOS patch
- Contribute patch to OpenBIOS project

### Problem: OF Forth bootloader never runs

**Cause**: OpenBIOS doesn't reach bootloader execution

**Solution**:
- Try manual `01000000 go` from OF prompt
- Use disk boot method
- Check serial port connection
